# page titles

**Priority:** High  

## Overview  
Page titles are crucial for SEO and user engagement. This feature ensures page titles are generated using a default formula while allowing the flexibility to override them manually in the CMS when required. This approach aligns with best practices for both automation and customisation, ensuring consistency and strategic control.  

## Implementation Requirements  

### 1. Default Formula:  
- Use the format: `{Hub Section Title} - {Parent Hub} | Boots {Locale}`  
  - Example: "Nutrition Tips - Health Hub | Boots UK"  
  - Example: "A-Z Health Services - Comprehensive Care | Boots UK"  

### 2. CMS Override:  
- Allow content editors to override the default formula via the CMS.  
- Enable the Boots marketing team to input custom page titles for specific strategic or marketing purposes.  

### 3. Output Validation:  
- Validate page titles to ensure they are concise (under 60 characters) and aligned with SEO best practices.  
- Prevent duplicate titles across the site to avoid cannibalisation.  

## Best Practices  
- Use strategically chosen keywords within page titles to boost SEO.  
- Ensure titles are descriptive, relevant to the page content, and engaging for users.  
- Regularly review and update titles to reflect evolving SEO strategies and business priorities.  

## Benefits  
- Provides a consistent and automated default for page titles, reducing manual effort.  
- Offers flexibility for strategic customisation by the Boots marketing team.  
- Enhances SEO with optimised, keyword-rich, and unique titles.  
- Improves click-through rates by presenting compelling, user-friendly titles in search results.  

## Conclusion  
A dual approach to page titles, combining a default formula with CMS override functionality, is essential for balancing efficiency with strategic control. This method ensures consistency while allowing flexibility for specific business or marketing objectives, ultimately improving SEO and user engagement.
