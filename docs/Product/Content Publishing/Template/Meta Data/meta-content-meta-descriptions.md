**Priority:** Medium  

## Overview  
Meta descriptions provide a brief summary of page content in search engine results. This feature involves processing and returning meta description content in the initial HTML response, with the flexibility to override defaults when necessary.

## Implementation Requirements  

### 1. Formula (Default):

#### Example:  
- Meta Description: "Read about Nutrition Tips at Boots UK and what you need to know."  
- Meta Description: "Read about Newborn illnesses & common skin conditions at Boots UK and what you need to know."  

### 2. CMS Override:  
- Provide content editors the ability to override the default formula via the CMS.  
- Allow the Boots marketing team to input a custom meta description when required.  

### 3. Output Validation:  
- Ensure that both formula-based and custom meta descriptions are concise (under 155 characters) and relevant.  
- Validate meta descriptions for proper syntax and alignment with SEO best practices.  

## Best Practices  
- Ensure descriptions are accurate, engaging, and relevant to the page content.
