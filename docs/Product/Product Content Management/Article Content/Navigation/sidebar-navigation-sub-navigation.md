# sub-navigation

*Priority:** Medium  

## Overview  
The sub-navigation feature is focused on managing section-specific menus within the **Content Hubs** region of the website. This functionality enables users to discover articles on relevant subjects they are searching for by providing organised and intuitive access to content. The sub-navigation is fully managed within the CMS, offering content editors the tools to create, update, and customise menus to align with the evolving needs of the website and its users.  

## Implementation Requirements
