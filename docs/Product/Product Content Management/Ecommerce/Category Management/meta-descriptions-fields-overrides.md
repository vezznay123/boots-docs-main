    **Priority:** Medium

    ## Overview
    The Meta Descriptions Fields (Overrides) feature allows administrators to customize meta descriptions for product category pages, enhancing SEO and user experience. This is achieved through a dedicated override field within the category editor.

    ## Implementation Requirements

    ### Default Description Logic
    - **Optional Logic:**
      - Optionally, define a default meta description generation logic based on category name, description, or other relevant fields.
